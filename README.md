Prediction on Heart Disease Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques
I have uploaded code only for Decesion Trees and Neural Networks could'nt upload other due to copyrights.

Heart related diseases or Cardiovascular Diseases
(CVDs) are the main reason for a huge number of
deaths in the world over the last few decades and
has emerged as the most life-threatening disease, in
the whole world. Machine Learning algorithms and
techniques have been applied to various medical datasets
to automate the analysis of large and complex data
. Many researchers, in recent times, have been using
several machine learning techniques to help the health
care industry and the professionals in the diagnosis of
heart related diseases.
Medicine and hospital resources these days have become
more expensive and difficult to afford. There are lot of
regions where medical resources are still out of reach.
Working on this is one of my major interests. Analyzing
the previous data and having given some useful data
we can do the prediction analysis. Cardiomyopathy and
Cardiovascular disease are some categories of heart
diseases. The reduction of blood and oxygen supply
to the heart leads to heart disease . In this paper
the data classification is based on supervised machine
learning algorithms which result in accuracy, time taken
to build the algorithm.
